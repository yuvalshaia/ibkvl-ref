In This Release
===============

This file describes the seth Linux* Example Driver for Linux Network Connection.  
This driver supports kernel versions 2.4.x and 2.6.x.  This driver includes 
support for Itanium(R)2-based systems.

This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time.  

The following features are now available in supported kernels:
 - Native VLANs
 - Channel Bonding (teaming)
 - SNMPDegradation in throughput performance may be observed in some Jumbo 
   frames environments. If this is observed, increasing the application's 
   socket buffer size and/or increasing the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*mem entry 
   values may help. See the specific application manual and 
   /usr/src/linux*/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt for more details.

Channel Bonding documentation can be found in the Linux kernel source:
/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt

The driver information previously displayed in the /proc filesystem is not
supported in this release.  Alternatively, you can use ethtool (version 1.6
or later), lspci, and ifconfig to obtain the same information.

Instructions on updating ethtool can be found in the section "Additional
Configurations" later in this document.


Building and Installation
=========================

To build a binary RPM* package of this driver, run 'rpmbuild -tb
<filename.tar.gz>'.  Replace <filename.tar.gz> with the specific filename
of the driver.

NOTE: For the build to work properly, the currently running kernel MUST
      match the version and configuration of the installed kernel sources.
      If you have just recompiled the kernel reboot the system now.

      RPM functionality has only been tested in Red Hat distributions.

1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice.  For
   example, use /home/username/seth or /usr/local/src/seth.

2. Untar/unzip archive:

     tar zxf seth-x.x.x.tar.gz

3. Change to the driver src directory:

     cd seth-x.x.x/src/

4. Compile the driver module:

     make install

   The binary will be installed as:

     /lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/kernel/drivers/net/seth/seth.[k]o

   The install locations listed above are the default locations.  They
   might not be correct for certain Linux distributions. 

5. Load the module using either the insmod or modprobe command:

     modprobe seth

     insmod seth

   Note that for 2.6 kernels the insmod command can be used if the full
   path to the driver module is specified.  For example:

     insmod /lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/kernel/drivers/net//seth.ko

   With 2.6 based kernels also make sure that older seth drivers are 
   removed from the kernel, before loading the new module:

     rmmod seth; modprobe seth


6. Assign an IP address to the interface by entering the following, where
   x is the interface number:

     ifconfig ethx <IP_address>

7. Verify that the interface works.  Enter the following, where <IP_address>
   is the IP address for another machine on the same subnet as the
   interface that is being tested:

     ping  <IP_address>


Command Line Parameters
=======================

If the driver is built as a module, the  following optional parameters
are used by entering them on the command line with the modprobe command
using this syntax:

     modprobe seth [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

For example, with two Gigabit PCI adapters, entering:

     modprobe seth TxDescriptors=80,128

loads the seth driver with 80 TX descriptors for the first adapter and
128 TX descriptors for the second adapter.

The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

NOTES:  For more information about the AutoNeg, Duplex, and Speed
        parameters, see the "Speed and Duplex Configuration" section in
        this document.

        For more information about the InterruptThrottleRate,
        RxIntDelay, TxIntDelay, RxAbsIntDelay, and TxAbsIntDelay
        parameters, see the application note at:
        http://www.intel.com/design/network/applnots/ap450.htm

        A descriptor describes a data buffer and attributes related to
        the data buffer.  This information is accessed by the hardware.



Additional Configurations
=========================

  Configuring the Driver on Different Distributions
  -------------------------------------------------
  Configuring a network driver to load properly when the system is started
  is distribution dependent.  Typically, the configuration process involves
  adding an alias line to /etc/modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf as well
  as editing other system startup scripts and/or configuration files.  Many
  popular Linux distributions ship with tools to make these changes for you.
  To learn the proper way to configure a network device for your system,
  refer to your distribution documentation.  If during this process you are
  asked for the driver or module name, the name for the Linux Base Driver
  for the Gigabit Family of Adapters is seth.

  As an example, if you install the seth driver for two Gigabit adapters
  (eth0 and eth1) and set the speed and duplex to 10full and 100half, add
  the following to modules.conf or or modprobe.conf:

       alias eth0 seth
       alias eth1 seth
       options seth Speed=10,100 Duplex=2,1

  Viewing Link Messages
  ---------------------
  Link messages will not be displayed to the console if the distribution is
  restricting system messages.  In order to see network driver link messages
  on your console, set dmesg to eight by entering the following:

       dmesg -n 8

  NOTE: This setting is not saved across reboots.

  Jumbo Frames
  ------------
  Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the MTU to a value larger than
  the default of 1500.  Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size.
  For example:

       ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up

  This setting is not saved across reboots.  It can be made permanent if
  you add:

       MTU=9000

   to the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth<x>.  This example
   applies to the Red Hat distributions; other distributions may store this
   setting in a different location.


  Ethtool
  -------
  The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
  diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information.  Ethtool
  version 3.0 or later is required for this functionality, although we 
  strongly recommend downloading the latest version at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel.


  NAPI
  ----
  NAPI (Rx polling mode) is supported in the seth driver.  NAPI is enabled
  or disabled based on the configuration of the kernel.  To override
  the default, use the following compile-time flags.

  To enable NAPI, compile the driver module, passing in a configuration option:

       make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DE1000_NAPI install

  To disable NAPI, compile the driver module, passing in a configuration option:

       make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DE1000_NO_NAPI install

  See www.cyberus.ca/~hadi/usenix-paper.tgz for more information on NAPI.
